# friis transmission formula
# yeah this may just be a bunch of disconnected variables but does that really matter? as soon as we get RF coming out of a radio, we can start connecting this to the associated libraries.

import math

antennaGain = 0 # in dB
outputPower = 0.00 # in watts
powerDensity = 0.00 # in watts per square meter
distance = 0.00 # we're solving for this
effectiveAperture = 0.00 # of recieve antenna
powerRecieved = 0.00

    print(1/(4*math.pi))

friis()

print(math.pi)
